Will scrape the current bitcoin price from GDAX every second.
Will calculate how much money in US dollars and bitcoin im gaining/losing. 
Will output the current dollars and bitcoin I have.
Will output the current Bitcoin/USD rate.
Will store the current bitcoin price in a variable and will calculate the percent gain/lodd from this amount for 60 runs. After 60 runs, this variable will then be reassigned to the newest price. Will eventually use this to make a graph and store that graph in a database. 

NEXT PLANs:
Will track gain/loss for my individual exchanges and will notify me when to sell/buy to make profit
