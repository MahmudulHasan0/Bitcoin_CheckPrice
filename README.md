Two Programs: "Bitcoin_GDAX.py" and "Bitcoin.Transactions.py"

Both programs will scrape the current bitcoin price from GDAX every second and then calculate how much money in US dollars and bitcoin im gaining/losing. 

"Bitcoin_GDAX.py" will:
	1) tell me how much money (USD) im gaining/losing in the current bitcoin market
	3) 
	4) Will output the current Bitcoin/USD rate.
	5) Will store the current bitcoin price in a variable and will calculate the percent gain/lodd from this amount for 60 runs. After 60 runs, this variable will then be reassigned to the newest price. Will eventually use this to make a graph and store that graph in a database. 

NEXT PLANs:
Will track gain/loss for my individual exchanges and will notify me when to sell/buy to make profit
